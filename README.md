# Kickstarting with Excel-Assignment 1

## This project is to investigate the relationship between the outcomes and launch date, and the  outcomes and goals. 

### The purpose is to show correlation between the variables through tables and charts.

## Analysis and Challenges
###There isn't a clear correlation between the variables and the outcome due to lack of additional tables and charts. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The outcomes based on launch date shows a trend of more successes during May, June and July; it is possible that more people would attend plays during summer times. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The outcomes based on launch date shows more successes for lower goals than higher amounts. It may be easier to attain lower amount than higher productions. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The first conclusion is the outcome may be seasonal since more successful outcomes fall around the summer season. 
The second conclusion is that cancellation may not depend on season since it takes place throughout the year evenly. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The higher the goal, the more likely to fail or cancel. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset does not contain current campaingnes. It also does not include any major events; since it may be more influential to the outcome than just the season. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
If we include the demographic of the countries or the major events around the world, such as disasters or warfares around the world; or energy crisis that may effect the outcome more directly.
